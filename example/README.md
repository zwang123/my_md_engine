# Testing the Molecular Dynamics Engine

A simple test and example of how to use this MD engine

## Prerequisites
* [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)

## Compilation
See the `../` folder

## Test and Examples

Run `./test.sh` to compile and test the MD engine.

`*.inp` files show an example of input files of this MD engine.

`plot_*.sh` files are analysis codes to plot MD results.

Note: These Bash scripts were written for Research Computing Center (RCC)
clusters at the University of Chicago. It is possible that your system does not
support these modules. Just make sure that you have all the dependencies at the
right place and then everything should work fine.

Note2: The input files are designed for debugging, so it might look ugly. In an
actual simulation this should not be the case.
